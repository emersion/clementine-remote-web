clementine-remote-web
=====================

A web interface for Clementine powered by Node.js

Install:
```shell
npm install
bower install
```

Run:
```shell
node .
```

Since Browserify is used, if you want to edit `client.js` run `./build.sh` after (you will need `browserify`/`watchify` to be installed: `npm install -g browserify watchify`).
